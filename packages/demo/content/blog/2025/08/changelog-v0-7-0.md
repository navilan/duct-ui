We're excited to announce **Duct UI v0.7.0**, a significant release focused on enhancing our static site generation capabilities with powerful content management features and improved developer experience.

Duct now supports generating HTML pages from a content directory of markdown files. This allows for generating blogs from posts written exclusively in markdown.

- **Configurable Content Directory**: Added `contentDir` configuration option with proper path resolution

### Enhanced Markdown Support

- **Excerpt Markers**: Support for `<!--more-->` markers to define custom content excerpts without requiring description metadata
- **Prism.js Integration**: Full syntax highlighting for code blocks in markdown content with support for TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, JSON, Bash, and more
