## Why Duct? Web Framework for the Age of AI

Duct is designed for a world where humans and AI collaborate on code. Our explicit, transparent approach ensures that whether code is written by you or generated by AI, it remains understandable, debuggable, and maintainable.{.lead}

### The Problem with Modern Frameworks

Many modern frameworks rely on:
- **Hidden magic** - Re-renders happen "somehow", state updates trigger cascading effects
- **Implicit behavior** - Lifecycle methods fire in mysterious orders
- **Virtual abstractions** - Layers between you and the actual DOM
- **Complex debugging** - Stack traces through transpiled code and framework internals

When AI generates code for these frameworks, you inherit all this complexity. Debugging becomes a nightmare. Understanding what the code does requires deep framework knowledge.

### The Duct Solution: Radical Explicitness

Duct takes a different approach - **everything is explicit**:

~~~typescript
// You see exactly what happens:
function bind(el: HTMLElement) {
  const button = el.querySelector('.submit-btn')
  const input = el.querySelector('.user-input')
  
  // Direct DOM manipulation - no magic
  button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const value = input.value
    console.log('Submitting:', value)  // Easy to debug!
    // Process the value...
  })
  
  // Explicit cleanup
  return {
    release: () => {
      // You control exactly what gets cleaned up
    }
  }
}
~~~

### Why This Matters for AI-Assisted Development

When AI generates Duct code:

1. **You Can Understand It Immediately**
   - No hidden lifecycle methods to worry about
   - Direct DOM queries show exactly what elements are used
   - Event handlers are standard addEventListener calls

2. **Troubleshooting Is Straightforward**
   - Set a breakpoint anywhere - the code flow is linear
   - console.log works exactly where you'd expect
   - No framework magic intercepting your debugging

3. **Maintenance Is Simple**
   - Need to change behavior? Just modify the explicit code
   - Want to add a feature? Insert it where it logically belongs
   - Refactoring is safe because dependencies are visible

### Real-World Benefits

**Traditional Framework (Hidden Complexity):**
~~~jsx
// Where does this update? When does it re-render? 
// What triggers the effect? Hard to debug!
function Component() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Mystery: When exactly does this run?
    fetchData(value)
  }, [value]) // Hope you got the deps right!
  
  return <input onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />
}
~~~

**Duct (Explicit & Debuggable):**
~~~typescript
function bind(el: HTMLElement) {
  const input = el.querySelector('input')
  
  // You control exactly when this runs
  input.addEventListener('change', async (e) => {
    const value = e.target.value
    console.log('Input changed to:', value) // Debug here!
    const data = await fetchData(value)
    console.log('Fetched data:', data) // And here!
    // Update DOM explicitly
  })
}
~~~

### Built for Modern Development

Duct embraces modern development practices while maintaining simplicity:

- **TypeScript-first** - Full type safety without complexity
- **Component Library** - Ready-to-use components that follow the same explicit patterns
- **Static Site Generation** - Build fast sites with selective reanimation
- **Content Management** - Markdown-based content with powerful processing
- **DaisyUI Integration** - Beautiful components without CSS complexity

### The Philosophy

We believe that in the age of AI:
- **Explicit is better than clever** - Code should show what it does
- **Visible is better than hidden** - Dependencies and effects should be obvious
- **Direct is better than abstract** - Work with the DOM, not against it
- **Simple is better than easy** - A bit more code for a lot more clarity

### Join the Explicit Revolution

Whether you're building a simple website or a complex application, whether you're coding solo or with AI assistance, Duct gives you the clarity and control you need.
