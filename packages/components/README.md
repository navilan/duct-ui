# Duct UI Components

![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40duct-ui%2Fcomponents)

The Duct component library offers a battery pack consisting of standard library of components which can either be used as is, composed or simply copied and modified to create derived components.

Some of the components in the library offer styles for tailwind. You can import them in your
`main.css` file using the `@source @duct-ui/components/path/to/css;` directive.

See [the repository overview](https://github.com/navilan/duct-ui) for more insight into the whys and hows of Duct.

The [Duct Website](https://duct-ui.org) offers comprehensive set of demos to understand its capabilities, workings and the built-in suite of components.

> **⚠️ Under Construction**: This library is currently in early development and may exhibit unexpected behavior. APIs are subject to change and components may not be fully stable. Use with caution in production environments.
