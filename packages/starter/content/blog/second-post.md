This is the _second post_ in the Duct Starter Template blog. It's here to demonstrate that the blog system can handle multiple posts and show them in a list.

You can create as many blog posts as you need by adding markdown files to the `content/blog/` directory.

Each post supports:
- Frontmatter metadata
- Markdown content
- Tags and categories
- Author information
- Featured post flags

This simple post shows how easy it is to add content to your Duct UI application!
