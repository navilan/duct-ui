# This is the Second Post

This is the second post in the Duct Starter Template blog. It's here to demonstrate that the blog system can handle multiple posts and show them in a list.

You can create as many blog posts as you need by adding markdown files to the `content/blog/` directory.

Each post supports:
- Frontmatter metadata
- Markdown content
- Tags and categories
- Author information
- Featured post flags

This simple post shows how easy it is to add content to your Duct UI application!
